of appointments booked on Healthengine were being made outside working hours.</p><p>One in five users were seeing their GP within four hours of booking their appointment and 55 per cent were seeing them within 24 hours.</p><p>Healthengine was founded in Perth and WA patients are its biggest users \u2013 of the 9 million appointments, 2.3 million were booked in WA.</p><p>This was a 28 per cent increase on 2017 and represented 800,000 patients, meaning almost a third of the state&#x27;s total population is now booking online.</p><p>One of them is Perth&#x27;s Louise Pedreschi, mother to two
