Patients would be followed up for at least two years.</p><p>The surgeons said the most likely cause of BII is the body’s inflammatory response to contaminants or bacteria but it would take more than a decade to find definitive answers.</p><p>“These illnesses patients describe could all be manifestations of the same thing,” Dr Deva said.</p><p>The surgeons said women concerned about BII should be taken seriously and treated appropriately.</p><p>Last week the US Food and Drug Administration held a two-day public hearing to discuss breast implant safety, including breast implant-associated <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/healthcare/rare-cancer-risk-for-women-with-textured-or-smooth-breast-implants-20190212-p50xcn.html" target="_blank">anaplastic large cell lymphoma (a rare form of cancer)</a>, implant registries, potentially banning breast implants with textured surfaces, as well as breast implant illness.</p></div><div></div><div><p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported the FDA <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/implant-files/fda-kept-hundreds-of-thousands-of-breast-implant-incidents-hidden-from-public/" target="_blank">kept hundreds of thousands of breast implant incidents reports</a> hidden from the public.</p><p>Jane Kimpton, founder of an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Breast.Implant.Illness.Awareness.Aus.NZ/" target="_blank">Australian BII support group on Facebook</a>, said she welcomed robust research into BII, but was sceptical whether plastic surgeons with commercial ties to implant manufacturers were the most appropriate researchers.</p><p>Dr Magnusson and Dr Deva consult and coordinate research for Johnson &amp; Johnson and Allergan. Dr Deva also works with Motiva and Sientra.</p><p>“In the meantime, all these tests, referrals and appointments are costing women thousands of dollars,” Ms Kimpton said.</p><p>She said some women had suffered debilitating symptoms for years, but now social media influencers with relatively minor ailments and self-proclaimed experts were joining the bandwagon.</p></div><div></div><div><p>&quot;This is not just something for 20-somethings in bikinis on Instagram to blog about,&quot; Ms Kimpton said. “Then there are the pseudo-natural therapists who are suddenly experts in treating [BII] and trying to create a niche market. Women are just desperate to get answers.”</p><p>Roberta Hongiman, a social worker who specialises in plastic surgery patients, suspects the uptick in women coming to her with BII concerns over the past two years was driven by “unsavoury social media hysteria” but added some of these women are feeling very unwell and extensive testing was not providing answers.</p><p>“These women are not idiots or drama queens. Their concerns need to be taken seriously.&quot;</p><p><br/></p></div><div><div><div><div id="adspot-N-6x2-pos1"></div><div id="adspot-N-300x164-pos1"></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>Kate Aubusson is Health Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald. </p></div><div><div><section><header><h2>Most Viewed in National</h2></header><div><span><span></span><span>Loading</span></span></div></section></div></div></div></div><aside></aside></section></article><div><div><small>Advertisement</small></div></div><div><section><div></div></section><div></div></div></div>
