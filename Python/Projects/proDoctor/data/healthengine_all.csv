					<div class=""description-content"">
											<p>The founder of House of Fertility &amp; Healing, Ngaio has been a practicing Acupuncturist for over 22yrs, a Chinese Herbalist for 13 of those years, and has 30yrs overall experience working in the health field. Her special interest in women’s health ranging from puberty to menopause has helped hone her particular areas of expertise in the TCM treatment of fertility/infertility and in pregnancy Acupuncture. Well known throughout Sydney, many Midwives, Gynaecologists and Obstetricians often refer patients to her.</p>
<p>As a pragmatic intuitive, Ngaio encourages a collaborative healing process through which the health issues on hand become tools and opportunities for her patient to learn more about the body/mind connection and how to proactively take better care &amp; responsibility for oneself. She utilizes both Chinese (Acupuncture, cold laser, Chinese Herbal Medicine) and western medical models alongside dietary &amp; lifestyle coaching to diagnose and address any issues that may be undermining the conception, development and birth of a healthy baby, and a radiant mother. Ngaio is here to support each woman’s birth plan and their health goals.</p>
<p>Niche areas of expertise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy – for example, miscarriage prevention, morning sickness, pubic symphisitis, pain management, pelvic instability, carpal tunnel, labor preparation, anxiety about birthing, postpartum support &amp; recovery including Mastitis and breastfeeding issues.</li>
<li>Fertility – both natural fertility support and also IVF support, preparation prior to pregnancy, and anovulation.</li>
<li>Women’s health – menstrual disorders of all kinds is one of the areas Chinese medicine reigns supreme. For example, period pain, Endometriosis, irregular periods, heavy or inter-menstrual bleeding.</li>
<li>Children’s health – when a child receives correct treatment their bodies respond immediately. Their bodies are different to adults.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Ngaio continues to regularly update her skills &amp; knowledge via post graduate learning, trips to China for research and study under older &amp; wiser therapists, industry seminars, mentoring newer practitioners &amp; a regular meditation practice.</p>
<p>Ngaio works by appointment from House of Fertility &amp; Healing on Tuesdays (8.30am-7pm), Thursdays (8.30am-8pm) &amp; Fridays (11am-7pm).</p>										</div>

My mum is a nurse working mostly in operating theatres, while my dad changed careers from being a medic in the Australian Army to becoming an acupuncturist and naturopath.

When I finished high school, I chose to move to Melbourne to study Chinese Medicine.&nbsp;I enjoy treating a range of conditions, such as insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome, back and neck pain, arthritis, and have an interest in women&rsquo;s health (premenstrual tension, irregular periods, infertility, IVF support), auto-immune disorders such as fibromyalgia, and providing emotional support for those with anxiety and insomnia.&nbsp;My treatments aim at re-balancing the whole body, to give you an improved quality of life. To help regain this balance, I use a combination of Acupuncture, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Cupping, Gua Sha, Bowen Therapy, Moxibustion and Massage.&nbsp;Other health services available in the area include a general practitioner, pharmacy and dentist, and a little further out we have radiology and pathology services.&nbsp;As a private billing practice, we strive to provide the highest quality services for our patients.

This is typically a pleasant, deeply relaxed, light headed or floating sensation. We encourage you to tell your practitioner how you feel during treatment, so to make the experience as pleasant as possible. Practitioners follow strict hygiene principals and only use single-use sterile needles.It's important to understand there is a difference between traditional acupuncture and a newer technique called ""dry needling"". Acupuncture should be practiced in it's traditional context, i.e. points are chosen according to the Chinese medicine diagnosis. Dry needling is based on Western medicine and there is no utilisation of Chinese medicine theory.Chinese Herbal Medicine We use concentrated granule herbs. The prescription is still made up individually, but in a powder-type from. The granules are very high potency of Chinese herbs. The manufacturing process involves the raw herbs being boiled up and the steam also captured. This is sprayed back into the herbs as they are drying into granule form. One teaspoon equals the typical one cup of boiling up herbs. Instead of drinking a cup of smelly liquid, you only have to take one teaspoon of granules. Although strong tasting, they are easier to drink than boiling up herbs and very convenient.Our herbs are all made up individually for each patient. You do need a prescription from a practitioner to get herbs from our clinic. We also offer a repeat prescription pick-up service. We can repeat any of your previous herbal formulas and can post them out or you can pick up without a consultation. You can now even order them from our online store.Tuina Chinese Massage Our one-hour session of Tuina includes a professional consultation with a TCM practitioner, the tuina massgae treatment (approx. 30 mins) and cupping therapy. The main difference between Tuina and other massage therapies is that it's done through the clothing, it usually is stronger thatn remedial massage, therefore shorter treatments are often used. Our tuina practitioners have Chinese hospital training.&nbsp;If you want to receive only Tuina massage, regular patients can book a 30 minute session which is massage only- no cupping.Fees:Acupuncture&nbsp;Initial $95Subsequent $75Chinese MassageOne-hour Treatment $75Half-hour Treatment $48",47683,,,,"Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, Massage",
