                                            Since graduating from the University of Sydney in 1997, Dr Choy has continually progressed as a highly regarded plastic surgeon. Dr Choy completed his general surgery postgraduate studies at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, and by 2004 had gained a fellowship with the<br><br><br><br>Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (FRACS). It was here that Dr Choy refined his talent as a general surgeon (focusing on breast and skin oncology) and also with reconstructive surgery (face, breast and body work).<br><br><br><br>Dr Choy’s dedication earned him more fellowships in 2004, when he completed sub speciality training in breast surgery at the Sydney Breast Cancer Institute, along with surgical oncology at the Sydney Melanoma Unit, now known as the Melanoma Institute Australia. The tireless determination paid off, with Dr Choy being selected for advanced surgical training in plastic and reconstructive surgery.<br><br><br><br>In 2005, Dr Choy completed his Master of Surgery thesis on patient preferences in multidisciplinary breast care, for which he was awarded a National Breast Cancer Foundation scholarship. The evolution of advanced surgical procedures and best clinical practices is evidenced by Dr Choy’s pursuit of excellence, and upon completion of plastic surgery training he was awarded a second FRACS fellowship in plastic surgery in 2010.<br><br><br><br>During 2010, Dr Choy further expanded his expertise and knowledge base by completing his plastic surgery fellowship at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide. Here he honed his skills in reconstructive and cosmetic breast plastic surgery as well as related body contouring works. Another fellowship followed soon after, with Dr Choy specialising in surgical and non-surgical cosmetic facial procedures with the Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.<br><br><br><br>The intensive formative training, followed by years of dedicated practice, has resulted in Dr Choy becoming a leading plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgeon. Dr Choy’s qualifications are extensive. He is a member of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), the Australian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) and the International Confederation of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (IPRAS).<br><br><br><br><br><br>                                        </li>",,,https://www.chinesedoctor.com.au/pictures/profile/pimage-9244-298-photo.png,"Blepharoplasty, Body Lift, Breast Augmentation, Breast Implants, Breast Lift (mastopexy), Breast Reconstruction, Double Eyelid Surgery, Facelift, Rhinoplasty, Tummy Tuck (abdominoplasty)","English,Mandarin,Cantonese","L2/115 Sailors Bay Rd , Northbridge, NSW, 2063",Ellis Choy,"Member of Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons, Australian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery  IPRAS, American Society of Plastic Surgeons",,,,,,"L2/115 Sailors Bay Rd , Northbridge, NSW, 2063",,,Zilver Lining Plastic & Cosmetic Surgery,"Plastic surgery-breast reduction, tummy tuck, arm reduction, thigh reduction, eyelid surgery, otoplasty, body lift, rhinoplasty, liposuction",,,"<li class=""col-sm-8"">
